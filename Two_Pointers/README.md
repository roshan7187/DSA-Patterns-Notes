# 🔁 Two Pointers Pattern

## 🧩 When to Use
- Array or string problems

- Sorted arrays (most common)

- Need to find pairs / subarrays

- Problems involving sum, reverse, comparison

## 🧠 Core Idea
- Use two indices to scan the array

- Move pointers based on a condition

- Reduce unnecessary comparisons

## 🔄 Variants
- Left & Right pointers (start–end)

- Slow & Fast pointers

- Same direction pointers

- Opposite direction pointers

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes
- Using on unsorted array without sorting

- Forgetting index format (0-based vs 1-based)

- Wrong pointer movement condition

- Missing left < right condition

## ⏱ Complexity
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)

## ✅ Problems
