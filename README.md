# 🧠 DSA Pattern-Based Problem Solving

This repository contains my **daily DSA practice**, organized by **problem-solving patterns** rather than random questions.

The goal is to:
- Master core DSA patterns
- Maintain clean, interview-ready explanations
- Enable fast revision before interviews

📌 **Code + notes live in problem files**  
📊 **Revision & tracking handled separately**

## 🧩 How to Use This Repo

- Each **pattern folder** has:
  - `README.md` → pattern theory & template
  - Problem files → code + notes

- Each **problem file** contains:
  - Key insight
  - Edge cases
  - Mistakes
  - Final solution

---

## 🎯 Preparation Philosophy

- Focus on **patterns**, not problem count
- Write notes in **your own words**
- Revise weak areas first
- Stay consistent
